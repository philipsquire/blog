    <p> With the Xbox Series S/X, and PlayStation 5 on the horizon, what new innovations in games can we expect? The answer: None at launch! <br>
    Or rather, none worth spending $500 on brand new hardware. For reference, here are the list of games going to be avaiable at launch for each console that will <em>not</em> be available on current generation consoles (in one form or another):<br>
    <br>
    PlayStation 5:
    <ul>
        <li>Astro's Playroom</li>
        <li>Demon's Souls</li>
        <li>Destruction AllStars</li>
        <li>GodFall</li>
        <li>Sackboy: A Big Adventure</li>
    </ul>

    That seems a little bit empty. What does Xbox have for us? <br>
    <br>

    Xbox Series S/X: <br>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    
    I stand corrected. If you do not care about fancy "Next-Gen" features and simply are here for new and exciting games, PlayStation 5 has some action and some platforming, but that is about it. Everything you can get on Xbox Series S and X, however, will also be available on the Xbox One that is currently available (and not for too much if you are willing to get one used.) <br>

    There is, however, one major upgrade that you will see if you buy a new console at launch: improved performance on current generation games.
