    <h3>About the "Next Generation" Consoles</h3>
    <time>2020-10-05</time>
    
    <p> With the Xbox Series S/X, and PlayStation 5 on the horizon, what new innovations in games can we expect? The answer: None at launch!
    Or rather, none worth spending <strong>$500</strong> on brand new hardware. For reference, here is the list of games avaiable at launch for each console that will <em>not</em> be available on current generation consoles (in one form or another):</p>
    <p> PlayStation 5:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Astro's Playroom (Pre-installed on the console) </li>
        <li>Demon's Souls (A remake of the PlayStation 3 game of the same name)</li>
        <li>Destruction AllStars (Vehicle destruction in an arena)</li>
        <li>GodFall (Yet another looting-action game)</li>
        <li>Sackboy: A Big Adventure (Friendly family platformer staring the protagonist of LittleBigPlanet)</li>
    </ul>
    <p> That seems a little bit short. What does Xbox have for us?</p> 

    <p>Xbox Series S/X:</p> 
    <ul>

    </ul>
    
    <p>I stand corrected. If you do not care about fancy "Next-Gen" features and simply are here for new and exciting games, PlayStation 5 has some action and some platforming, but that is about it. Everything you can get on Xbox Series S and X, however, will also be available on the Xbox One that is currently available (and not for too much if you are willing to get one used.) </p>

    <p>There is, however, one major upgrade that you will see if you buy a new console at launch: improved performance on current generation games. </p>

    <p>Beside the obvioius decrease in load times (due to the Solid State Drives in both consoles), gameplay may feel smoother due to increased processor speed and graphics power. Some games may even be prettier, with PS5's boost mode, which will be available for select games, and the Series S/X's Auto-HDR implementation, which will make every game have HDR.</p>

    <p>There is one more thing I would like to talk about: pricing. And not the price of the consoles, you. We are currently in the middle of an economic recession, and yet a fair amount of large video game publishers have decided is that <em>NOW</em> is the best time to raise video game prices by $10. However, they seek to make the transition easier by <i>only</i> raising the price of games on the new consoles. </p>

    <p>This is especially attrocious considering most of the AAA video game publishers make more money off of the microtransactions in their games than they do from selling them. These microtransactions have been actively hurting the video games industry, and are not going away because these companies do not care if they have to use predatory tactics to extract as much money as humanly possible from people like you and me.</p>

    <p>The final subject I would like to address is the emminent confusion between console versions. While Playstation mostly has this covered between the standard edition and the digital edition being $100 dollars apart and the digital edition just not having the disk drive, Xbox has a little bit more of an issue.</p>

    <p>Xbox, like Sony, has two systems for the new generation. One is the Xbox Series S, a lower powered console with no disk drive for $200 cheaper than the Xbox Series X. Let me ask you one quesion: How are people supposed to know the difference between the Series S and Series X? The answer is, most won't. People will no doubt get confused come christmas time, and end up getting the wrong one. Here is a nice comparison table for you</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Console</th>
            <th>Release Date</th>
            <th>Storage</th>
            <th>Disk Drive</th>
            <th>Target Resolution</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Playstation 5 Standard Edition</td>
            <td>November 12</td>
            <td>825GB</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>2160p</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>November 12</td>
            <td>825GB</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>2160p</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Xbox Series X</td>
            <td>November 10</td>
            <td>1024GB</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>2160p</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Xbox Series S</td>
            <td>November 10</td>
            <td>1024GB</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>1080p/1440p</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>All in all, the launch of the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series S/X can be summed up in one image, just like the rest of the world at the moment.</p>

    <h3>The Current State of Streaming Services</h3>
    <time>2020-10-05</time>

    <p>Now that we all want to distract ourselves from reality, even just for a tiny bit, let's talk about how streaming services are doing in the United States of America. </p>

    <h4 class="service">Netflix</h4>

    <p>The original! This one has come quite a ways. It started as a service to mail DVDs, and now, it lead to the slow painful death of physical media! Hurray! With it's (mostly) low-quality original content and also licensing content (which made it popular in the first place) that it is so rapidly losing.</p>

    <p>They admirable have also been trying to get into international content, which is great for people who like stuff that isn't American. Unfortunately, anime fans are going to be a bit disappointed. Specifically, those who like the classics. Netflix's (and admittedly Studio Khara who provided a <b>VERY</b> literal translation) handling of the famous <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i> and its sequel movie <i>The End of Evangelion</i> sparked massive outrage among the fanbase, from a subpar translation to a lackluster new dub, to even the inability to license the ending theme Fly Me to the Moon.</p>

    <p>They also have other content that I haven't really checked out much, such as Midnight Diner, and really, all anime that airs in Japan on TV, then waits to be released all at once everywhere else (which drives the anime fandom used to watching week by week up the wall).</p>

    <h4 class="service">Hulu</h4>

    <p>They used to run off of Fox's content, but now they also have the shows and movies that Disney doesn't want on Disney+ (more on that in a bit)! They also license and make deals with TV channels as well. </p>

    <h4 class="service">Disney+</h4>

    <p>A relatively new streaming service comprised of everything Disney (including the Disney Channel originals, no less). The issue here is there is way too much that Disney owns, which is why some of its mature content gets sent to Hulu now. This image tells you what Disney owns now. </p>

    <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/the_mouse/comments/94dkfe/diagram_of_disneys_properties_after_the_21st/">Image Source</a></p>

    <p>It's mostly popular franchises, including The Simpsons and Star Wars, that get the most attention, with Disney also attempting Netflix Original-like shows (The Mandalorian was the biggest and most successful). Luckily, Disney set the price relatively low, so you can enjoy all of the Disney classics, if you're into that.</p>

    <h4 class="service">Amazon Prime Video</h4>
    <p>It's Netflix, but with slightly (and I do mean <em>slightly</em>) better video there might be things you like, and there may not. It's really give or take. It has the most licensed content, but a good amount of it is trash no one cares about.</p>
    
    <h4 class="service">HBO Max</h4>

    <p>Last but not least, we have HBO Max, the "curated" streaming service. This one is more focused on hosting not only HBO content (Don't worry Game of Thrones, it's still here) but also a good chunk of Warner Brother's catalog. In addition, they have struck deals with Cartoon Network, Crunchyroll, and DC to spice things up. While having a focus on fewer but higher quality licensed series sounds good in practice, we will find out soon enough if that means they will finally come to Roku devices, as the HBO Max app is currently unavailable on Roku because large corporation reasons.</p>

    <p>I will leave you with one final thing: my definitive streaming service ranking!</p>

    <ol>
        <li>HBO Max</li>
        <li>Netflix</li>
        <li>Disney+</li>
        <li>Hulu</li>
        <li>Amazon Prime Video</li>

    </ol>
